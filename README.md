# MyRouter

package dariuszp/myrouter

My router for GO http server. I was pissed off by existing routers and way they handle paths and params.
**This router is still in development.**

I do not bundle this router with any manager for handlers, controllers or whatever you come up with. Each router is named. You are free to decorate this router with methods that will handle your kind of handlers.
